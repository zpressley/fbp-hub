**01/01/2026**  
 

### ***Preamble:***

***We the Founders of Fantasy Baseball Pantheon, in order to form a more perfect league, establish justice, ensure managerial tranquility, provide for the common demands, promote the sanctity of Baseball, and secure the blessings of the Baseball gods to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the league \- Fantasy Baseball Pantheon.***

### ***Overview:*** 

***Fantasy Baseball Pantheon is a “Keeper / Dynasty” League that utilizes offline drafting & contract systems for managers to build and maneuver their team’s strategy to achieve year to year success.***  

***The League is intentionally designed to maintain the feel & functionality of traditional redraft leagues, as it allows for daily free agent transactions and for significant roster turnover from year to year.***  

***Within the structure of this league \- managers will need to navigate opportunities to build overall organization value across two systems: Keeper System & Prospect System.*** 

***FBP rules & gameplay emphasizes winning strategies regardless of team positioning.  Drafting rules reward teams who finish at the top of consolation tournaments & final playoff matchups.***

***Lastly, managers of FBP are expected to be available and active throughout the year.  We utilize several tools to have easy access to information & communication.  Managers will need to understand the commitment to time, research, and community when joining this league and be respectful to their fellow league peers who have also made this commitment.***

   3. Players that exceed their prospect status during the season in FBP are assigned a TC-R contract value

## **Section 03: Salary Manipulation Tools**

1. Teams will be permitted to use salary manipulation tools to reduce a qualified player’s contract value in two forms:  
   1. IL Tag  
      1. Used for injured players to reduce their cost burden  
   2. Reduce a Tier (RaT)  
      1. A high cost purchase to reduce the contract tier of the most expensive players for tax relief & potentially future window gains  
2. IL Tag Rules & Qualifications:  
   1. Teams are permitted to assign 1 IL Tag per contract type to reduce the cost burden of that player to be kept that year  
      1. TC \= \-$10 WB  
      2. VC \= \-$15 WB  
      3. FC \= \-$35 WB  
      4. *Ex: VC-2 ($55) player is injured and the manager applies IL Tag (-$15) to reduce the cost to $40 WB for that KAP*  
   2. Applying an IL Tag will still increase a player’s contract to the next tier  
   3. TC-R/TC-BC rookies are ineligible for IL Tag  
   4. Players must have sustained an injury prior to September and then never returned to action (including October baseball) \- OR \- they are projected to miss time in the coming year (commissioner approval required)

      1. Teams are required to roster but cannot place in the lineup if the player returns healthy before week 6 without penalty.  
3. Reduce a Tier Rules & Qualifications:  
   1. Teams are permitted to spend $75 WB of tax free spend during the KAP to lower a player’s contract tier.  
      1. *Ex: Manager spends $75 WB on FC-1 ($85) player to reduce his contract to VC-2 ($55).  Player is kept at only a $55 tax hit and becomes an FC-1 again for the next season as opposed to an $85 tax hit and raised to an FC-2 ($125).*  
   2. RaT may not be used on a Team Contract  
   3. RaT may not be used to reduce a contract to a Team Contract tier  
   4. RaT may be used only during KAP  
   5. RaT may be used multiple times on a keeper to continue lowering their tier

3. FBP Managers may maintain ownership of Prospects without rostering on their Yahoo Roster by following system rules and regulations.  
4. Prospects hold their own contract statuses with teams until they are graduated to a keeper level contract.  These contracts are:

   2. Purchased Contract (PC)  
   3. Blue-Chip Contract (BC)  
5. All Contracted Prospects are protected from the Prospect Draft, the Auction Portal, & Yahoo Free Agency

3. Prospects with a DC who make their MLB debut are compelled to be Purchased for a $15 WB fee.  
   1. Once this fee has been paid the prospect is now under a Purchased Contract (PC) and is no longer a DC  
   2. If a team chooses not to pay or cannot afford to pay the fee, the prospect’s DC contract is voided and the team will no longer have ownership of the Prospect  
      1. Prospect enters the next Auction Portal.  If no claims are placed and the prospect remains in the MLB, the Prospect becomes an addable Free Agent in Yahoo

   1. If a BC Prospect exceeds MLB Rookie Limits, thus removing them from qualifying for their previously held Top 100 status, but not FBP Limits and the manager chooses not to graduate as a result \- they will qualify for retaining their Blue-Chip Contract the next pre-season.  
5. Blue-Chip Prospects who graduate are awarded eligibility for a unique Keeper Contract (TC-BC)
